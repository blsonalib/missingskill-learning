# 1. What is React ?
- React is a javascript UI library.
- It is developed by facebook in 2011.
- It is used a component-based approach that can be reuse overall project.
- It has some features that's why react is more popular than other frameworks.

# 2. What are the features of React and Explain them?
## 1. Components
- Components are the building block of React application.
- Single applications contain multiple Components.
- Components are used to split the independent reusable part of an application that can be processed separately.
- React has two types of Components

**1. Class based component/Statefull component.**
- The class-based component writes by using the Class keyword
- The class-based component has its own state
- The class-based has their own render method

**2. Functional component/Stateless component**
- The Functional component has no own state and render method  
- They may derive data from other components as a props 

## 2.JSX
- JSX is a syntax extension from the javascript library
- JSX stands for javascript XML
- JSX is used to describe what the user interface should look like
- With the help of JSX, we can write the HTML structure into the same file that contains javascript code.
- Browser does not know the JSX because the browser reads only a plain javascript object and JSX is not a plain object to convert JSX into plain JS one transpiler used called babel

## 3. Unidirectional data flow
- React follows the one-way data binding means when designing a react app we often nest child withing parent-child
- With the help of one data binding, we can debug errors easily and find where is the problem occurs 

## 4. Virtual DOM
- React keeps a lightweight representation of real DOM called Virtual DOM.
- When the state of an object changes Virtual DOM only change this state of the component rather than updating all the object.

## 5. High Performance
- Because of virtual dom react has to update only changed component rather than updating all the component at once. The result is the performance of the application is high.


# 3. What is react router ?
- React router is a library used in react to navigate one to another because react used to create single-page application
- React router has some component Link,NavLink, Route, BrowserRouter and Switch
    - Link - It is work the same as an anchor tag link only difference is Link is used to navigating the page without refreshing the page
    - NavLink - It is used to style the active routes and It is work same as Link.
- React router has some hooks useLocation(), useRouteMatch(), useParams(),useHistory()

# 4. What is state ?
- It is nothing but the object in react.
- The state contain all the information and logic of the component
- The state of an object changes the component update only this changes rather than updating/re-rendering all the components
- The state is mutable
- Update the state by using setState()
- In Functional component we can manage the state by using useState() hook

# 5. What is props ?
- Props is a property that can be used as an attribute in component same as HTML attributes
- With the help of props, we can pass the data from one component to another component
- It is immutable
- It can read only

# 6. What is event ?
-  Event is an action that user or system may trigger for example mouse click, press the keyboard button.

# 7. What is key ?
- Key is a unique identifier It is used to identify which item of the list is update ,delete and add.
- It is used to determine which component need to be re-render instead of re-rendering all the component every time. 

# 8.What are the Life Cycle Methods in react ?
- getInitialState()- This method execute before creating a component
- componentDidMount() - This method execute when the components get render and placed into a dom
- shouldComponentUpdate() - This method invoked(call) when a component wants to change into the dom it gives true or false value depending on certain condition
- componentDidUpdate() - This method invoked immediatly after rendering takes place
- componentWillUnmount() - This method invoked immediatly before component distroyed  

# 9. What is render() method ?
- Every component has render() method
- It returns an HTML which is to display in the component
- If we want to render more than one element all the element must be inside the parent tag <div></div> or <></> (react fragment synthetic sugar form)

# 10. What is hook ?
- The hook is a new feature introduced the react in the 16.8 version
- The hook is a javascript function we use in the Functional component.
- Before react 16.8 version if we want to manage the state we used a class-based component but after the 16.8 version we manage the state by using 
useState() hook
**Pre-requisites**
- Hook use inside the function at the top
- We can't use hook inside class

# 11. What is useState() ?
- The useState() is a hook.
- The useState() is used to manage the state.

# 12. What is useEffect() ?
- The useEffect() is a hook.
- If we want to do something after rendering the component that time useEffect() hook is used
- The useEffect() allows Functional component to have lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount

# 13. How to create a React app ?
- Install node because node has npm package this package has react library
- npx create-react-app <appname>(small letter)
- Any text editor we can use for example vsCode, sublime text , atom etc
    
# 14. What is props drilling ?
  - If we have 4 component App, componentA, componentB and  componentC and 
     componentA is a child of App 
    ,componentB is a child of componentA,
    componentC is a child of componentB and pass the data as props from App component to componentC we cant pass data (props) directly to the  App
    to componentC we have to pass data to the all the parent component this ia called as props drilling
    
 
**Example 1 :-** 
``````
import './App.css';

const ComponentA = ({name}) => {
  return (
      <ComponentB name={name}/>
  )
}


const ComponentB = ({name}) => {
  return (
     
      <ComponentC name={ name}/>
     
  )
}


const ComponentC = ({name}) => {
  return (
      <div>
          <h1>Hello guys, my name is { name}</h1>
      </div>
  )
}


function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ComponentA name={ "sonali"}/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

``````
